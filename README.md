# An-Exploration-of-the-Unbanked-in-the-U.S.
## Introduction
Millions of U.S. households are **unbanked** with no access to traditional banking (i.e. checking, savings or credit union accounts) and **underbanked** (i.e. use alternative financial instruments such as payday loans). Trust in the financial system, proximity to bank branches, account maintenance fees, and poor credit history deter these households from participating in traditional banking. Without access to traditional banking services, these households turn to predatory payday lending or check cashing services to conduct major transactions such as leasing an apartment. 
**FinTech**, financial technology that improves and automates the use of financial services, aims to make mainstream banking more accessible. One strategy is to provide the un(der)banked access to no-fee mobile banking with no credit history requirements. This approach may leave some of the un(der)banked behind due to lack of acces of a mobile phone or internet. Further, some FinTech lending apps use algorithms based on historical data like the mainstream banking sector leaving those with poor credit without access to loans or access at high interest rates akin to payday loans.

## Project
We hope to support community banks as well as the FinTech **sniper**, **amplifier**, and **educator** startups tackling disparities in mainstream banking reach of the un(der)banked households that have been left behind. More specifically, we will develop a **cURL project dashboard** that identifies the key characteristics of the un(der)banked population at the county level, the key factors prohibiting their participation in traditional banking, and suggested financial literacy resources. 

The end user can identify:

**1.** What are the demographic characteristics of the unbanked and underbanked population in the United States? 
**2.** What share of the unbanked and underbanked lack access to internet services and/or mobile devices? 
**3.** What are the determinants of traditional banking alternatives (e.g. payday lending) usage? (Predictive model)
